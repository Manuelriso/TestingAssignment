Fault Simulation

Preparing...

Selected fault status: NA NN AN 
Failure modes: DEFAULT

Scanning database for faults and results, keep only faults with selected status ...
FM 'DEFAULT' has 49584 prime faults (95448 total faults), 201 selected for fault simulation
   Testcase 'test1': 201 testable prime faults that have no previous results
Workload: 201 combinations of FM x testcase x prime FID


Create initial set of tasks
   Task 3 created with 201 prime faults for faultsim of FM 'DEFAULT' with testcase 'test1'
Preparation took 2s


Starting execution of task3 using 1 worker
