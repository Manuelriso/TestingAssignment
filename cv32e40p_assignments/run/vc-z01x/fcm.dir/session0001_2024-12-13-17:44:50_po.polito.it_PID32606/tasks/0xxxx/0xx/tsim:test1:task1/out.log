Note-[FSDB_DYN_ACTIVE] Reduction of value changes in the FSDB file active.
  Switch '-tsim=limit_toggle*' has been given. Value changes in the FSDB file 
  will be reduced, for example, scalar signals will appear flat-lined after 
  the next few toggles.
  Change runtime switch to '-tsim=limit_toggle:0' if you want a regular, 
  unreduced FSDB file.
