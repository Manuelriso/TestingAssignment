Testability Analysis

Scanning database for testcases and previous results from testability analysis ...
   Task 1 (tsim) created for testcase 'test1'
   Task 2 (coats) created for testcase 'test1'
Preparation took 0s


Starting execution of 1 tsim and 1 coats tasks using 1 worker
Will store resulting fsdb files in /home/s329514/TestingAssignment/cv32e40p_assignments/run/vc-z01x/fcm_tsim_fsdb/cv32e40p

Fault Simulation

Preparing...

Selected fault status: NA NN AN 
Failure modes: DEFAULT

Scanning database for faults and results, keep only faults with selected status ...
FM 'DEFAULT' has 49584 prime faults (95448 total faults), 201 selected for fault simulation
   Testcase 'test1': 201 testable prime faults that have no previous results
Workload: 201 combinations of FM x testcase x prime FID


Create initial set of tasks
   Task 3 created with 201 prime faults for faultsim of FM 'DEFAULT' with testcase 'test1'
Preparation took 2s


Starting execution of task3 using 1 worker
